AVR-USB-I2C

This is hardware and firmware for a USB interfaced I2C controller.

Firmware and hardware are here.  BatchPCB board is here:

Be aware I haven't received an actual board yet back from BatchPCB,
so it may not actually work, although it's been prototyped and tested 
on a one-sided board.

Linux/Mac library to talk to the board is written and will be uploaded
to github.  Currently it's in subversion at:

https://svn.fireflymediaserver.org/svn/pic/mpusb
